Hook is a Haskell program to make managing ToDo lists easier. It enables scripts that support the following syntax:

> ***priority:job

on each line. Hook is not the whole story to a completely working todo manager. The "schedule" bash script enables usage of Hook with common commands. "append" and "put" must also be put in your $PATH for this to work. Hook is written in Haskell, and append and put are written in C++.

When the entire Scheduler "distribution" is installed, it can be used like this:

Interactive (asks for input, calls Hook with command line arguments)
> scheduler add
> scheduler strike
> schedule list [all]

Non-interactive (all arguments)
> scheduler pass add [job] [priority]
> scheduler pass strike [toStrike]
> scheduler pass list [priority|all]
